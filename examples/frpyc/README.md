# frpyc

The application *frpyc* is a variant of *frpyc_slup*.
The most notable difference is that *frpyc* does not use SLUP for
communication between the server and the client. Instead, standard TCP
is used here. Actually, *frpyc* is a predecessor of *frpyc_slup*.
The applications are not compatible, thus, the Android client of
*frpyc_slup* cannot be used here.
